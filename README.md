##Description:

A python script that runs in the background and syncs a local folder to google-drive like Dropbox. This is
still very much a work in progress.

##System Requirements:

in ~/.zshenv or ~/.bashrc

##Implemented so far:

* Uploading files, folders to different folder hierarchies
* Updating files in different folders
* Deleting files, folders in different hierarchies


##Todo:

* Moving a folder and all its contents to another target folder
